# Le DÃ©cideur - The Decidor
Mobile app that randomizes choices to help make a decision

This fun mobile app is a tool to help indecisive people (like myself).

This is my first personnal project :)

Through the decidor character the app will randomly pick amongst a list of choices to make a decision.

There are some predefined categories such as:

* What to eat ?
* What to do tonight ?
* Who's right ?
* Should I ?
* When ?
* Personalised choice

The user can always customize these categories with his own personnal choice, the app will remember them. If the user wishes to restore the default choices he can do so in the options.

Once the decidor has picked a choice it is saved in a database and can be found in the library alongside the time stamp and the picture of said choice.

In the options, the user can restore the default choices, activate/deactivate the sound effect and modify the decision speed.
All changes are stored locally on the user's device.
